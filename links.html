        <h2>Modern Day Slavery/America's prisons</h2>
        <p>The 1994 Federal Crime Bill basically led to the expansion of the prison system. It increased state funding for prison, put 100,000 police officers in the street and contributed to the prison population. “In the Reagan era, the war on drugs became a part of our modern culture and the African American community because it was unjustly overrepresented in the news as criminals. The Nixon and Reagan administration are responsible for the cycle of criminalizing African Americans suffering from drug addictions, rather than increasing resources for rehabilitation”(cjpcenter.com).Prisons aren’t run by the government. They are privately owned businesses run through the CCA. In the last 20 years CCA has seen profits increase by more than 500%. They made a total revenue of $481.1 million in the fiscal year of 2019. CCA is a direct partner with ALEC, which helps business’s connect to politicians to pass federal and national laws. ALEC stands for the American Legislative Exchange Council, and it’s made up of politicians and members of corporations. The council is directly responsible for the Florida “Stand Your Ground” law. They are also responsible for SB 1070, which gives police the right to stop anyone that looks like an immigrant. In the 13th amendment, the amendment responsible for banning slavery in America, includes a loophole that still makes slavery legal in prison. For example, Walmart, Whole Foods Market, Microsoft, Nintendo, Target, Dell and other countless companies use unpaid prison labor to minimize cost of operations. Between 1980 and 2015, the number of people incarcerated in America increased from roughly 500,000 to over 2.2 million.Today, the United States makes up about 5% of the world’s population and has 21% of the world’s prisoners. 1 in every 37 adults in the United States, or 2.7% of the adult population, is under some form of correctional supervision.
        <br>
        <br>
          
        In 2014, African Americans constituted 2.3 million, or 34%, of the total 6.8 million correctional population. African Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites.
        <br>
        <br>
        The imprisonment rate for African American women is twice that of white women. Nationwide, African American children represent 32% of children who are arrested, 42% of children who are detained, and 52% of children whose cases are judicially waived to criminal court. Though African Americans and Hispanics make up approximately 32% of the US population, they comprised 56% of all incarcerated people in 2015. If African Americans and Hispanics were incarcerated at the same rates as whites, prison and jail populations would decline by almost 40%. In the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 17 million whites and 4 million African Americans reported having used an illicit drug within the last month. African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites.
        <br>
        <br>
        African Americans represent 12.5% of illicit drug users, but 29% of those arrested for drug offenses and 33% of those incarcerated in state facilities for drug offenses. These statistics are all true, and unfortunately and criminal record can have lifelong consequences. A criminal record can reduce the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent. The negative impact of a criminal record is twice as large for African American applicants. Infectious diseases are highly concentrated in corrections facilities: 15% of jail inmates and 22% of prisoners – compared to 5% of the general population – reported ever having tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C, HIV/AIDS, or other STDs. In 2012 alone, the United States spent nearly $81 billion on corrections. Spending on prisons and jails has increased at triple the rate of spending on Pre‐K‐12 public education in the last thirty years. There are currently 19 million disenfranchised voters in the United States.

          All Lives Matter vs. Black Lives Matter
        </h2>
        <p> The All Lives Matter movement has been often associated to Black lives Matter. It may seem obvious that all lives do matter, it is important to understand that this is a direct counter movement to the Black Lives Matter movement. It is a direct protest to a civil rights protest. All lives can’t matter until Black lives matter, so be smart and be on the right side of history. If someone around you says Blue Lives Matter, simply say that being a Police Officer is a choice, and people who are Black did not get a choice, yet they are treated differently for no reason.

How to explain it to kids/family members:<br>
	    Imagine a house is on fire in a neighborhood. The firefighters show up and start extuinghing the fire because that is their job. They continue extinguishing the fire, but all the other neighbors get upset because the fire fighter isn’t helping their houses. The firefighters respond saying, “They don’t need it because their house isn’t on fire.” But the neighbors get upset and say “All houses matter”. The fire fighter then responds, “Yes, we do agree that all houses matter. But right now we are working on saving the house on fire because it needs the attention, because it’s on fire”. 
  <br>
  <br>
In this analogy the house on fire is the African American community, and they are in need of the media attention to bring light of these issues. We all need to stand together and help combat police brutality!

   <br>
         <strong>“What is White Privilege?”</strong> White privilege doesn’t mean you won’t have experienced difficulties in your life. It also doesn’t mean you are white AND wealthy. It means that the color of your skin isn’t making your life more difficult. White privilege means that you benefit because racism exists. 
        <br>
         <br>
        <strong>“How Do I Benefit?”</strong> When I watch television and read magazines most people look like me. I am less likely to die in childbirth. It is a choice to teach children about racism (not a necessity). I am sure the police wont single me out because of my skin color. I can access health and well ebing services without the fear of racist comments. I am never asked, nor have to speak on behalf of all people in my race. 
         <br>
          <br>
        <strong>“I just don’t believe in this term White Privilege” </strong> I’ve been listening to the experiences of BIPOC and I have started to see how it works in every part of their life. Have you ever felt fearful of the police because of the way you look? How often are you the only white person in the room? Have you ever been worried that your children will be subjected to racist comments? Have you ever been worried that you won’t get a job because of your race? When you watch TV are most people your race/ethnicity? I think once you start to learn more, the more you will see it too.
       <br>
        <br>
       <strong>“I’ve had a difficult life and I’ve moved on.”</strong> White Privilege doesn’t mean you haven’t had a hard life, but simply by having whute skin there are things that you won’t have to experience such as police brutality or racism. You can;t move on when the system is still operating to benefit white people. By saying “it’s all in the past” Is a way for white people to excuse themselves from the ways that they are still benefiting from slavery.
          <br>
           <br>
       <strong>“Why are you talking to me about white privilege?”</strong> Because I’m learning that racism isn’t the responsibility of BIPOC to dismantle. Over the last few weeks I have been reading and I have been listening a lot. I’ve made a commitment to be actively ant-racist. I’ve realised my white privilege contributes to the racist systems in the country and I am going to talk about it a lot more with my friends, family and co workers.
